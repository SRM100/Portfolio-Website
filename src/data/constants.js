        `This project is my University Minor Project and focuses on an innovative, 
         solar-powered robotic solution designed to assist in various agricultural tasks. 
         The robot integrates multiple mechanisms, including grass-cutting, spraying, 
         and obstacle-avoidance capabilities, all while being powered by solar energy. 
         This combination makes it an environmentally sustainable, multi-functional 
         agricultural aid.`,
        
        `Key Features and Functionalities:
         - Grass-cutting, spraying and obstacle avoidance
         - Powered by an onboard solar panel for uninterrupted performance
         - Operable via mobile device for remote control`,
         
        `Conclusion: An eco-friendly, multi-functional robot for efficient agricultural management.`
